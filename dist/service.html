              <h5>Allergies</h5>
              <p>
                Allergy symptoms occur when your body’s immune system overreacts
                to a normally harmless substance (food, pollens, grasses and
                dust). The body mistakenly interprets the allergen —the dust or
                food— as a threat to the body and mounts a strong immune defense
                against it known as a hypersensitivity reaction. It’s a sign of
                an over-reactive immune system and that something is out of
                balance in the body.

              <h5>Autoimmune Disorder</h5>
              <p>
                Autoimmune Disorders happen when the body’s natural defense
                system can’t tell the difference between your own cells and
                foreign cells, causing the body to mistakenly attack normal
                cells. We treat a wide range of autoimmune conditions affecting
                a huge breadth of body parts, including Thyroid problems,
                Rheumatoid Arthritis, Reynaud’s and Psoriasis.

                of the issues.

              <p>
                Fatigue is an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion that, at times,
                can be solved with rest however, sometimes this isn’t the
                solution. When fatigue is combined with other symptoms it can be
                even more difficult to treat. Your Naturopathic Physician can
                help you heal by identifying the reason you are feeling acutely
                tired and effectively addressing it.

              <p>
                Hormones are chemical messengers produced in the body that have
                specific effects on other cells and organs so any imbalance in
                them can have an impact on many facets of your health including
                fertility, menstrual irregularities, menopause and libido. Your
                Naturopathic Physician can help with the balancing of all

              <p>
                An accumulation in your tissues of heavy metals, like mercury,
                lead and uranium, from our environment can impact your physical
                health. Initially, we will determine if the level of heavy metal
                in your body is impacting you physically and if it is, we will
                build a safe and effective plan to remove the toxic metals from
                your system.

                Chronic pain, whether it be sports injuries, chronic headaches
                or a motor vehicle accident, can be debilitating. Our treatment
                begins with identifying the root cause of your pain. Once that
                is identified we will pick the most effective path from the
                variety of pain modalities we use, all of which are part of a
                whole body approach to provide long lasting pain relief.

              <h5>Thyroid Issues</h5>
              <p>
                Your thyroid controls many of your body’s functions. An over or
                underactive thyroid can cause many issues throughout the body
                including fatigue, depression, hair loss, headaches, unexplained
                weight gain or loss, anxiety, decreased memory or concentration,
                among many others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Naturopathic Physicians can evaluate and treat a dysfunctional
                thyroid by doing a complete blood test, identifying the root
                cause of your issues and offering treatment that will help
                relieve your symptoms.

                or physical stressors. The treatment chosen will depend on the
